# A simple project to demonstrate usage of reactjs with laravel #

This is a very simple app. it just takes a string inpunt from the home page, 
saves it in the database and returns the saved object to display in the front end

reactjs, react-redux, redux-thunk was to develop the front end

then finally little touch of some Bootstrap 4 and Animate.css to make things pretty :)
